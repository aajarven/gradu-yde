\section{History of Local Group Research}
LG objects visible with naked eye -> realization they are something outside our galaxy -> realization they are something very much like our galaxy

First determining distance was difficult, now mass is more interesting question

\section{Aim of This Thesis}
Whatever the main results end up being, presented in somewhat coherent manner and hopefully sugar-coated enough to sound Important and Exciting.


\chapter{Theoretical Background}
Think whether LG or LCDM first

\section{Local Group}
Definition of galaxy group, our local group is one of these.

Mass estimate (Li, Yang masses for the LG and MW)

Maybe something about scale of things in our universe, what are galaxy groups made of, what do you get if you go one distance scale up, what's different in galaxy clusters

\subsection{Structure}
Galaxies that are part of LG, distribution of smaller ones around bigger ones

Current mass estimates (at least timing argument, hubble flow and maybe satellites)

\subsection{Evolution}
How have we ended up in a situation described earlier? What will happen in future?


\section{Expanding universe}
\subsection{Discovery}
Make maths, add cosmological constant, make observations, remove cosmological constant

Enough cosmology here or in other sections to make other parts of thesis to make sense and to suffice as master's thesis = basic textbook cosmology and galaxy formation theory %t. puppe
\subsection{$\Lambda$CDM Cosmology}


\subsection{Hubble flow}
What is, where seen, what means, how to measure, hotness/coldness

Plot: observations with fitted hubble flow


\chapter{Mathematical and statistical methods}
Precision of the used equipment limits accuracy of all data gathered from physical experiments, simulations or observations. Therefore the results are affected by the measurement process and the results have to be presented as estimates with some error, magnitude of which is affected by both number of data points and accuracy of the measurement equipment. \citep{bohm2010introduction}

Estimating errors for measured quantities offers a way to test hypotheses and compare different experiments\citep{bohm2010introduction}. This is done using different statistical methods, a few of which are covered here. Methods used in this work are shortly introduced in the following sections.

\section{Regression Analysis}
line fitting and other trivial things

\section{Error analysis}

\section{Goodness of fit testing}
A common situation in scientific research is that one has to compare a sample to either a model or another sample in order to derive a conclusion from the dataset. In statistics, this is known as hypothesis testing. For example, this can mean testing hypotheses like ''these two variables are not correlated'' or ''this sample is from a population with a mean of 1.0''. \citep{wall2003practical} Next paragraphs shortly introduce the basic concept of hypothesis testing and methods that can used to test the hypothesis ''these two samples are drawn from the same distribution''.

Typically the process of hypothesis testing begins with forming of null hypothesis $H_0$ that is formatted such that the aim for the next steps is to either reject it or deduce that it cannot be rejected with a chosen significance level. Negation of the null hypothesis is often called research hypothesis or alternative hypothesis and denoted as $H_1$. For example, this can lead to $H_0$ ''this dataset is sampled from a normal distribution'' and $H_1$ ''this dataset is not sampled from a normal distribution''. Choosing the hypotheses in this manner is done because often the research hypothesis is difficult to define otherwise. \citep{bohm2010introduction, wall2003practical}

After setting the hypotheses one must choose an appropriate test statistic. Ideally this is chosen such that the difference between cases $H_0$ and $H_1$ is as large as possible. Then one must choose 
the significance level $\alpha$ which corresponds to the probability of rejecting $H_0$ in the case where $H_0$ actually is true. This fixes the critical region i.e. the values of test statistic that lead to the rejection of the $H_0$. \citep{bohm2010introduction, wall2003practical}

It is crucial not to look at the test results before choosing $\alpha$ in order to avoid intentional or unintentional fiddling with the data or changing the criterion of acceptance or rejectance to give desired results. Only after these steps should the test statistic be calculated. If the test statistic falls within the critical region, $H_0$ should be rejected and otherwise stated that $H_0$ cannot be rejected at this significance level. \citep{bohm2010introduction, wall2003practical}

This kind of probability based decision making is always prone to error. It is easy to see that $\alpha$ corresponds to the chance of $H_0$ being rejected when it is true. This is known as error of the first kind. However, this is not the only kind of error possible. It might also occur that $H_0$ is false but it does not get rejected, which is known as error of the second kind. \citep{bohm2010introduction}

Despite statistical tests having a binary outcome ''$H_0$ rejected'' or ''$H_0$ not rejected'', a continuous output is often desired. This is what p-values are used for. The name p-value hints towards probability, but despite it's name p-value is not equal to the probability that the null hypothesis is true. These p-values are functions of test statistic and the p-value for a certain value $t_{obs}$ of test statistic gives the probability that under the condition that $H_0$ is true, the value of a test statistics for a randomly drawn sample is at least as extreme as $t_{obs}$. Therefore if p-value is smaller than $\alpha$, $H_0$ is to be rejected. \citep{bohm2010introduction}

\subsection{Comparing two samples drawn from unknown distributions}

A common question in multiple fields of science is whether two or more samples are drawn from the same distribution. This can occur for example when comparing effectiveness of two procedures, determining if instrument has changed over time or whether observed data is compatible with simulations. There are multiple two-sample tests that can address this kind of questions, e.g. $\chi^2$, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cram\'er-von Mises and Anderson-Darling tests. \citep{bohm2010introduction, feigelson2012modern}

Out of these,the  $\chi^2$ test uses categorical data, for example ''number of data points between values 1.5 and 1.6'' or ''number of galaxies that are active'', and compares numbers of samples in different categories whereas the others compare empirical distribution functions (EDF) of the datasets. \cite{feigelson2012modern}

%TODO
TODO: mietippä pitäisikö seuraavat kappaleet siirtää ja jos niin minne

To understand EDF, one must first be familiar with probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF). As the name suggests, PDF is a function the value of which at some point $x$ represents the likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal $x$. Naturally for continuous functions the probability of drawing any single value from the distribution is zero, so these values should be interpreted as depicting relative likelihood of different values. For example if $\mathrm{PDF}(a)=0.3$ and $\mathrm{PDF}(b)=0.6$ we can say that drawing value $a$ is twice as likely as drawing value $b$. \citep{htk}

Another way to use the PDF is to integrate it over semi closed interval from negative infinity to some value $a$ to obtain CDF, which gives the probability of a random value drawn from the distribution having value that is smaller than $a$. %TODO jatka tähän

   \caption{Cumulative distribution function for three random samples drawn from different distributions, two of which are normal and one is uniform.}
   \label{fig:cdf}
\end{figure}

In addition to comparing two samples, these tests can be used as one-sample tests to determine whether it is expected that the sample is from a particular distribution. However, some restrictions apply when using the one-sample variants.
\citep{feigelson2012modern}

   \caption{Empirical distribution function for four random samples drawn from different normal distributions.}
   \label{fig:edf}
\end{figure}

For astronomers the most well-known of these tests is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which is also known as the KS test. Test statistic is calculated based on empirical distribution functions $\hat{F}_1$ and $\hat{F}_2$ derived from two samples and the test statistic
\begin{equation}
	D = \sup_{x} |\hat{F}_1(x) - \hat{F}_2(x)|
\end{equation}
uses the maximum vertical distance of the e.d.f's as shown in [ehdottomasti kuva tähän]. \citep{feigelson2012modern, bohm2010introduction} %TODO feigelssonin rajoitukset KS:lle ja muille, kerro tarkemmin tuolla mutta hinttaa jo tässä olemassaolosta
