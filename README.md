# HYgradu - a LaTeX package for theses

This is a LaTeX documentclass for making a Master's thesis at the University of Helsinki. This is primarily for the Department of Physics because the theses look very different at different departments.

## Installation

### Simple
Keep the HYgradu.cls file and sinetti.pdf in your working directory when writing the .tex file.

### More general
Add HYgradu.cls and sinetti.pdf to your LaTeX distribution tree to use it from any directory. Of course, this is a package you only usually need once so it's not that important.

## Usage
The simplest way is just to take the template provided with the class file and start editing that.
