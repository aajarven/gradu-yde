- hubble flow:
   - few examples
   - yhteenvetoplotti
   - 

- velocity dispersion
   - good, neljä plottia erikseen hyvä

- anisotropy mollweide
   - multiple plots (9?) with different volumes
   - absolute velocities too (see filaments etc)

- grouping
   - no need to repeat mollweide for multiple simulations
   - show same volume with multiple eps and ms
   - eps and ms in one 3d plot

- include error bars on new plots (H0 vs r0, LG mass cs r0)

Meeting after these:
[X] H0 and r0 distributions, their correlation?
[X] LG mass vs r0 where LG mass is either MW+A or everything within r0

- citation style either from ApJ or another journal

For meeting:
-
