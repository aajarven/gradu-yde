- hubble flow:
   - few examples
   - yhteenvetoplotti
   - 

- velocity dispersion
   - good, nelj채 plottia erikseen hyv채

- anisotropy mollweide
   - multiple plots (9?) with different volumes
   - absolute velocities too (see filaments etc)

- grouping
   - no need to repeat mollweide for multiple simulations
   - show same volume with multiple eps and ms
   - eps and ms in one 3d plot

- include error bars on new plots (H0 vs r0, LG mass cs r0)

Meeting after these:
[X] H0 and r0 distributions, their correlation?
[X] LG mass vs r0 where LG mass is either MW+A or everything within r0
[X] thesis outline, lis채채 otsikoita ja muutaman kappaleen kuvauksia what goes int
[X] refine table of contents, 2*theory and 2*results

For meeting:
-

Open questions:
- Split between theory and actual work does not seem to be very strict in Antti's and Nata's works: for example GADGET is described in sect 6 and FoF in sect 4. How strict should I be?
