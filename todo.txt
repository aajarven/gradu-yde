- hubble flow:
   - few examples
   - yhteenvetoplotti
   - 

- velocity dispersion
   - good, nelj채 plottia erikseen hyv채

- anisotropy mollweide
   - multiple plots (9?) with different volumes
   - absolute velocities too (see filaments etc)

- grouping
   - no need to repeat mollweide for multiple simulations
   - show same volume with multiple eps and ms
   - eps and ms in one 3d plot

- include error bars on new plots (H0 vs r0, LG mass cs r0)

Meeting after these:
[X] H0 and r0 distributions, their correlation?
[X] LG mass vs r0 where LG mass is either MW+A or everything within r0
[X] thesis outline, lis채채 otsikoita ja muutaman kappaleen kuvauksia what goes int

[ ] refine table of contents, 2*theory and 2*results

Simulation has same parameters as EAGLE
800 Mpc volume used
schaye 2015 paper
DM-only parts: Volker-Springer Gadget and Gadget 2 papers 1999 and 2005 or something, gravity part is more interesting than SPH
Zooms can use multiple meshes, only one is used here
gravitational softening

analysis techniques:
- fucking everything, starting from fitting lines and going out to clustering and stuff like that

include subfind description, thesis of iannuzzi
merger trees

Fattahi paper introduction contains interesting theorythingies

Hubble flow coldness/hotness

Li, yang, masses for the LG and the MW

2. structure formation, sigma8, integrating tophat
combine 2 and 3 to have one theory chapter
statistical analysis thingies

For meeting:
